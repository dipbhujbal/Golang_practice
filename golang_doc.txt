Every piece of Go code exists inside a package, and every Go program must have
a main package with a main() function which serves as the program’s entry point,
that is, the function that is executed first



Go functions and methods are defined using the func keyword. The main package’s main() function always has the same signature—it takes no arguments
and returns nothing. When main.main() finishes the program willterminate and
return 0 to the operating system



The reader may have noticed that the program has no semicolons, that the imports are not comma-separated, and that the if statement’s condition does not
require parentheses. In Go, blocks, including function bodies and control structure bodies (e.g.,for if statements and for for loops), are delimited using braces.
Indentation is used purely to improve human readability. Technically, Go statements are separated by semicolons, but these are put in by the compiler, so we
don’t have to use them ourselves unless we want to put multiple statements on
the same line. No semicolons and fewer commas and parentheses give Go programs a lighter look and require less typing
